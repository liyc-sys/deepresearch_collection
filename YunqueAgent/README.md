<!-- # Yunque DeepResearch -->

# Introduction

Deep research has emerged as a transformative capability for autonomous agents, empowering Large Language Models to navigate complex, open-ended tasks. However, realizing its full potential is hindered by critical limitations, including escalating contextual noise in long-horizon tasks, fragility leading to cascading errors, and a lack of modular extensibility. To address these challenges, we introduce **Yunque DeepResearch**, a hierarchical, modular, and robust framework. The architecture is characterized by three key components: (1) a centralized *Multi-Agent Orchestration System* that routes subtasks to an *Atomic Capability Pool* of tools and specialized sub-agents; (2) a *Dynamic Context Management* mechanism that structures completed sub-goals into semantic summaries to mitigate information overload; and (3) a proactive *Supervisor Module* that ensures resilience through active anomaly detection and context pruning. Yunque DeepResearch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, and Humanity’s Last Exam. We open-source the framework, reproducible implementations, and application cases to empower the community.

# Features

- ⚙️ **Effective Orchestration System**: We implement a centralized orchestration framework anchored by a Main Agent that serves as the strategic core. Utilizing a flexible dispatch mechanism, the planner dynamically routes tasks to the most appropriate resource within the Atomic Capability Pool: it directly invokes basic tools for low-latency atomic operations while delegating complex, long-horizon objectives to specialized sub-agents.
- 🗂️ **Dynamic Context Management**: We propose a **sub-goal-driven memory mechanism** to resolve the tension between context length and information density. By treating sub-goals as the fundamental unit of trajectory segmentation, our system dynamically partitions the research process: completed sub-goals are folded into concise structured summaries to maintain global planning awareness, while the active sub-goal retains fine-grained ReAct traces for precise execution. This hybrid approach transforms linear history into structured semantic milestones.
- 🧩 **Modularity and Extensibility**: We ensure adaptability through a modular **"Atomic Capability Pool"** that separates strategic planning from action execution. By standardizing basic tools and specialized sub-agents as functional units, our architecture attains high composability. This separation creates an extensible ecosystem where new capabilities—ranging from atomic utility functions to expert-level solvers—can be dynamically registered and deployed, ensuring the framework remains resilient to evolving requirements.
- 🛡️ **Stability and Robustness**: We incorporate a dedicated **Supervisor module** to ensure system stability and mitigate the fragility often seen in long-horizon tasks. Unlike rigid reflection schedules, this mechanism performs active anomaly detection on the agent's trajectory. Upon identifying failures, it triggers a self-correction protocol, explicitly prunes invalid context to prevent memory pollution, guiding the agent to autonomously recover and synthesize a viable alternative response.

# Quick Start

This guide provides instructions for setting up the environment and running inference scripts.

## 1. Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n yunque-dr python=3.10.0
conda activate yunque-dr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Configuration & Data Preparation

### Environment Setup

Initialize your configuration by copying the example environment file:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and provide your actual API keys and configuration values:

- **AGENT_API_KEY/AGENT_API_BASE**: OpenAI-compatible API credentials for the main agent.
- **SUMMARY_API_KEY/SUMMARY_API_BASE**: OpenAI-compatible API credentials for the summary model.
- **LLM_NAME/SUMMARY_MODEL_NAME**: The specific model names you wish to deploy.
- **SERPER_KEY_ID**: Your API key from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) (used for web search and Google Scholar).
- **JINA_API_KEYS**: Your API key from [Jina.ai](https://jina.ai/) (used for parsing web pages).
- **SANDBOX_FUSION_ENDPOINT**: The endpoint for the Python interpreter sandbox (refer to [SandboxFusion](https://github.com/bytedance/SandboxFusion)).
- **DATASET**: Path to your evaluation dataset.
- **OUTPUT_PATH**: Directory for saving results.

**Note:** For detailed descriptions of each variable, please refer to the comments inside `.env.example`.

### Input Data Format

The system accepts data in JSONL format. Prepare your dataset (e.g., `questions.jsonl`) using the following structure:

```json
{"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"}
{"question": "Explain quantum computing", "answer": ""}
```

**Note:** The `answer` field serves as the ground truth for automated evaluation. The system will generate its own response and compare it against this reference to calculate performance metrics.

## 3. Prepare API to call the model

The framework supports any **OpenAI-compatible API** (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, vLLM, SGLang).

- **External Providers**: Get your API Key and Base URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
- **Self-Hosted (vLLM/SGLang)**: Start your inference server.

  ```bash
  # Example: Launch vLLM server
  python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model /path/to/your/model \
    --dtype auto \
    --api-key token-abc123
  ```

## 4. Run Inference

Execute the inference script:

```bash
bash run.sh
```
